Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

 public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        
        int start = 0 , end = numbers.length-1;
        while(start<end){
            if(numbers[start]+numbers[end]>target){
                 end--;
            }else if(numbers[start]+numbers[end]<target){
                 start++;
            }else{
                 return new int[]{start+1,end+1};
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{};
    }
