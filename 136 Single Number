Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:


 public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
           ans = ans^nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
