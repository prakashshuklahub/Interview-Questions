Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0

public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
         
      int left = 0 , right = 0;
      Set<Character> seen = new HashSet();
      int max = 0;  
        
      while(right<s.length()){
          char c = s.charAt(right); //a
          if(seen.add(c)){
              max = Math.max(max,right-left+1);
              right++;
          }else{
              while(s.charAt(left)!=c){
                 seen.remove(s.charAt(left));
                 left++;
              }
              seen.remove(c);left++;
          }
      }
      return max;
    }
